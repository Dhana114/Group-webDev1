## Brief Summary

A Food Forum is a place to share ideas related to culinary topics, from recipes, to restaurants and otherwise. The method of sharing ideas is via posts so that other users can view the contribution made by a member of the forum. This means that only signed up persons who have created an account can post to the Food Forum. This also means that to see these posts, an account is required by another user. 

## Member rights

Should a member of the Forum, who does not author the post, desire to change the post, this will not be allowed. The member who authors a post or comment is the only user who can delete or update it.
